We are trying to create a warning and notification system to predict natural diaster such as floods and landslides which could very well have saved many lives in a calamity like the recent Kerala floods. We plan develop a Regression/Multiclass Classification model on the basis of rainfall data to predict the possibility of flood and landslide in a given region.We are also into finding data and developing a custom function for dealing with earthquakes with the help of a few seniors in this field so as to issue a warning for a possibility of an Earthquake(Exact Occurence has always been a tedious task to detect).Based on the analysis of this data would be genrating safety alerts/notifications and send them to nearby people.So basically we will be developing a mobile application. We will mark calamity prone areas and notify concerned people as soon as they come within a certain range.
We believe in "Quality over Quantity", so we plan to specialize in detection of a kind and be more accurate in it.

 ## **Use of Nearby Api**
We will be using Google's Nearby Api to send notification to nearby people on their phone.Also, We will inform nearby authorities over an sms

## **Mark Emergency Services**
We will pin-point nearby emergency services such as hospitals,fire-stations,forest rescue authorities, etc on Google Map and also indicate their contact details so that people can immediately call them during emergency.

## **Seek Manual Assistance** 
We will be adding an additional manual assistance button which on pressing sends notification to a nearby emergency authorities and two of their preset numbers(relatives)
