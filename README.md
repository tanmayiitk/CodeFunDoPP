We are trying to create a warning and notification system to predict natural diaster such as floods and landslides. We will develop a linear regression model on the basis of rainfall data to predict the possibility of flood and landslide in a given region. Based on the output of this data will be genrating alerts/notifications and send them to nearby people. We will mark diaster prone areas and notifies people as soon as they come within 10kms range.

 ## **Use of Nearby Api**
We will be using Google's Nearby Api to send notification to nearby people on their phone.Also, We will inform nearby authorities over an sms

## **Mark Emergency Services**
We will pin-point nearby emergency services such as hospitals,fire-stations,forest rescue authorities, etc on Google Map and also indicate their contact details so that people can immediately call them during emergency.

## **Seek Manual Assistance** 
We will be adding an additional manual assistance button which on pressing sends notification to a nearby emergency authorities and two of their preset numbers(relatives)
