Every year more than 1.3 million people loses there lives in road accidents and many of the accidental deaths could be prevented if emergency services reach the spot of accident in time. We are trying to develop an app that can help people by immediately informing the nearby authorities and their relatives. This app can drastically reduce the response time and the hence increases the probability of life saving.If we are able to reduce the number of deaths even by 10% than we will think we have made an impact on the society.From time to time we will be updating our app to enhance the accuracy.
We are also trying to create a warning and notification system to predict natural disaster such as floods and landslides which could very well have saved many lives in a calamity like the recent Kerala floods. 
We believe in "Quality over Quantity", so we plan to specialize in detection of a kind and be more accurate in it.


## **Mark Emergency Services**
We will pin-point nearby emergency services such as hospitals,fire-stations,forest rescue authorities, etc on Google Map and also indicate their contact details so that people can immediately call them during emergency.

## **Seek Manual Assistance** 
We will be adding an additional manual assistance button which on pressing sends notification to a nearby emergency authorities and two of their preset numbers(relatives)
